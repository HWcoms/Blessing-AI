## Voicemeeter Banana settings

Run Voicemeeter Banana. At the top right area where it says hardware out, click A1 and select your speakers/headphones. Wherever you want the desktop sounds to go, so you can hear them. 
There is WDM, MME and KS. Generally speaking choose WDM because this has a lower latency than MME.

To the left of Hardware Out section, there is the Virtual input section which shows Voicemeeter Banana's in-built virtual cables, VAIO and AUX.
Select A1 for the VAIO virtual cable. This VAIO cable represents VoiceMeeter Input/Output. 
By selecting VoiceMeeter Input as your default playback device earlier, any desktop audio will be played into this cable.
By selecting A1, you are sending your desktop audio via this cable into hardware out A1 (speakers/headphones). You should be able to hear your desktop audio now.
